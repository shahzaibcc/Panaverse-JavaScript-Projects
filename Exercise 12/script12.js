//Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. 
//The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names = ["Shahzaib", "Irfan", "Hamza", "Ali", "Ahmed"];
console.log(`Hello ${names[0]}, How are you?`);
console.log(`Hello ${names[1]}, How are you?`);
console.log(`Hello ${names[2]}, How are you?`);
console.log(`Hello ${names[3]}, How are you?`);
console.log(`Hello ${names[4]}, How are you?`);
